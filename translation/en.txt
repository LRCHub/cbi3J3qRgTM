[00:21.38] I'll never forget you Walking down this winding road
[00:30.77] The newborn sun and yellow sand traversing dreams
[00:41.05] The day we tickled each other and rolled around, never to return
[00:50.50] A future far noisier than I ever imagined awaits me.
[01:02.00] Just hearing "I love you" made me feel like I could be strong.
[00:59.73] 
[01:10.24] Hold the small joys so tightly they might break
[01:19.74] 
[01:20.96] With hands stained by overflowing thoughts I wrote it down
[01:29.89] I told you to throw that letter away immediately.
[01:40.48] A little sleepy, I forced myself awake with cold water.
[01:49.70] Now, as if being rushed, as if being blown away, it passes by.
[02:01.20] Just hearing "I love you" made me feel like I could be strong.
[01:58.89] 
[02:09.56] I hope to meet you again someday in this place.
[02:19.06] 
[02:27.64] No matter how far I walk, I can never reach My cheeks wet with the snow of my heart
[02:37.59] The song I tore apart while pretending to be a demon Turned into petals dancing in the spring breeze
[02:51.09] 
[03:13.79] I'll never forget you Walking down this winding road
[03:23.53] A future far noisier than I ever imagined awaits me.
[03:35.03] Just hearing "I love you" made me feel like I could become stronger.
[03:32.70] 
[03:43.16] Hold the small joys so tightly they might break
[03:53.39] I felt like I could live my life honestly or dishonestly.
[04:02.87] I hope to meet you again someday in this place.
